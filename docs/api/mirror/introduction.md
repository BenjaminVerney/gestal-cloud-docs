# Mirror Resources

A mirror resource is a data identified by a `vendor_id` (controlled by the integrator) and shared to the tenant.

Mirror resources cannot be modified by the Gestal system (at the exception of `gestal_id` attribute to facilitate synchronization).

If you're looking for a way to access Gestal system data, please take a look at [core resources](/api/core/introduction.html).
