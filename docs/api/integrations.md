# Integrations

Integrators have the ability to create system integrations to allow bridging our two ecosystems together.

Integrations are like applications, they can be installed by tenants on a per-site basis, thus providing integrators access to customer' site [core resources](/api/core/introduction.html) (see [integration installations](/api/installations.html)).

Integrators can also share data to tenants via [mirror resources](/api/core/introduction.html) (such as [sow mirrors](/api/mirror/sow-mirrors.html)).

:::tip Please note
You need to create an integration so tenants (farm owners, etc.) can make installations of your integration into their farm sites.
