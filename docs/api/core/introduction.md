# Core Resources

A core resource is a resource identified by a `gestal_id` that represent a data synchronized by the Gestal system.

They can be easily accessed trought integration installations but cannot be modified by them (read-only access).

If you are looking for a way to share data to tenants and their sites, please take a look at [mirror resources](/api/mirror/introduction.html).
